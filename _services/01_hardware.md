Paradigm changing innovation is often not just software. This is valid for the introduction of computers, laptops,
smartphones, electric cars, robots. If a company understands how to build hardware they are able to create complete
verticals. One of the most successful companies in the world, Apple, is a hardware company.

Hardware on itself is a commodity business. However, with software, and especially smart software, machine learning,
artificial intelligence, there are services built on top of the hardware that can be sold as well. These all come
with much higher margins than hardware alone. Monetization can be done through up-selling services (e.g. additional
AI functionality, or cloud storage), or by providing a market place (as with the Apple and Google stores). It can
also be done through lease constructs where a manufacturer benefits from recurring revenue in exchange for maintenance,
installation, support, and other services on top of the hardware itself.

An integrated service offering is not trivial to build. It requires both hardware engineers as well as experts in 
machine learning. It requires very flexible engineers, just being an electronics engineer is not enough.

An example. Crownstone, one of the companies funded through Almende Investments created a smart electronic connector 
that be used in parallel with an ordinary light switch. The solution for this is cross-cutting multiple disciplines. 
First, the user is explained how to add an additional wire at the switch so an ordinary light switch is changed into 
a pulse switch. During the time the switch is physically traveling from one pole to the next, there is a short dip
in the supply voltage of the Crownstone connector. The Crownstone connector is electronically equiped with a capacitor
that gives it enough "battery"-power to stay powered on when this voltage drops temporarily. This is a decisison by the
electronic engineer! Moreover, there is a voltage measurement circuit that samples with a rate of multiple kHz and 
there is firmware that detects if a dip has taken place. This is done through signal processing by the firmware 
engineers! If the engineers would just do their job on their own island, such functionality would be impossible to
offer to the customers!

There is another benefit of the contemporary software-infused hardware startups. Back in the day, only revenue and 
returns were metrics that could be used by investors. With modern hardware, there are all kind of metrics that can 
be used by investors to understand hardware companies with not so much traction yet. The hardware companies get
constant feedback on product usage and other metrics that are normally only SaaS metrics.

It is also possible to see hardware as a Troyan horse for software. With a very good software offering, it might not
be so trivial to switch from one product to the next. 

Modern hardware due to its software can become a completely new product overnight. For example, people are diligently
waiting for a new software update for a 
[Fuji camera](https://petapixel.com/2017/03/22/fujifilm-x-t2x-pro2-firmware-update-bring-33-improvements/). To 
describe the sentiment: "Fujifilm has a history of releasing firmware updates so significant that you feel like you're 
downloading a brand new camera". In the beginning people might not notice this, but over the course of time this has
the potential of gathering many fans! It moreover justifies a service or subscription model and is in accordance with
sustainability goals.

Unsafe at any speed. American cars were a hazard to their drivers in the fifthies. This was an opportunity to the
German manufacturers, from crumple zones to seat belts, they created robust cars with far less fatalities and 
conquered the market. 

Again, American companies are "Unsafe at any speed". This time it is regarding the use of data, data analysis, 
artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc. The privacy and safety of the users is not important to thos companies.
This is yet another time, European companies can benefit from this attitude. We can build companies that do care 
about the privacy of their users. This requires investments in technology as well. Those investments range from 
building end-to-end encryption systems to the advanced use of homomorphic encryption
(see [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/11/15/what-is-homomorphic-encryption-and-why-is-it-so-transformative/)).

The relationship with (personal) data with Chinese companies and products is just as troublesome. There can be 
backdoors and in general there has been much more progress on the hardware front than on the software front in China.
This means that there is not yet so much attention to the hackability of devices or the privacy aspects of the data
being processed by the devices. Compared to both American and Chinese companies, European companies have a 
strategic advantage.

Almende has a lot of expertise, built up in national and European projects. Almende is currently 
[involved](https://almende.com/energy-projects/) in projects like Moeebius, Opschaler, Dynka, SG-BEMS, Inertia, and
ACCUS. In those projects sophisticated algorithms are developed to use data in an IoT context.

Almende has a long track record of performing state-of-the-art research in this field. Startups with funding from
Almende Investments benefit from both the high-quality R&D done at Almende, but will also have an easier time
